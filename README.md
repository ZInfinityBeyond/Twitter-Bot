# Reddit & Twitter API Bot

## Synopsis
Second Python Project

Coded a Bot that uses the Twitter and Reddit API's respectively. The Twitter API is used for the bot and the Reddit API is to get information off Reddit and post it to Twitter.

#### What I learned
- What an API is and how to intergrate it properly.
- How to read documentation. Had to read the documentations for both the OS and urllib.request module since there were little to no videos on the subject. 
- Importing from another local file you’re working on. Up until this point, I was coding in jupyter and I couldn't do that, but after switching to VS Code I've seen the importance of having designated files for organization purposes. 

# Final Thoughts
The Credential file that is referenced in my code has my Twitter & Reddit API keys hence why it’s not uploaded for privacy reasons. This was my second project in early 2021 and I pushed through my anxiety of starting a project and failing. I didn't allow an empty terminal and my fear of failure to stop me because I loved learning more than the hardships I encountered. So many setbacks, many days I just read documentation and wrote little to no code, but it inevitably paid off. Word of advice just keep going because starting is always the hardest part and you’ll eventually overcome it with perseverance.
